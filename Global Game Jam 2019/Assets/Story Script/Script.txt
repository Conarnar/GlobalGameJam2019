"I miss my house. I just want to go back and enjoy my life. I don't even remember how long it's been since HE kidnapped me."

"If only he left my door unlocked just once, I could make a run for it..."

"Wait, my door is unlocked! I might be able to escape from this damn house."

"I shouldn't be going upstairs, I need to go downstairs to the front door."

"I might need this key just in case I can't leave the house."

Picked Up Key

"No time to stay here, I need to get home!"

"Oh no, the door's locked!"

"What are you doing out of your room, Angelica?"

"You know that's not my name, Greg!"

"IT'S 'Daddy' TO YOU MISS! Go to your room this instant!"

"Actually no I don't trust you to go back on your own, here I'll put you in there and you'll be grounded FOREVER!"

"DON'T TOUCH ME!"

"Why did it have to be locked. The one time that he locked both locks and it's when I get a chance to escape..."

"Hmmm... I wonder if this key unlocks my room. Greg didn't seem to lock the door with the key like usual. Maybe he dropped it before he came downstairs."

"It worked!"

"Ok, now to find the keys to the front door."

"Seems to be locked. I probably need a key of some sorts."

"I hate how Greg puts you in a cage all the time, Boo. You look hungry. I'll find you some food, 'kay?"

"A ha! I'll feed Boo this."

"Good boy Boo. It didn't use to be this bad you know. It all went down once they pas-."
"Hold on..." 
"Why is there a key in the cage?"

Picked Up Key

"I don't have the right key to open this door."

"Why isn't he in his room? He usually always is in here, right?"

"Why does he have so many different keys?"
"Oh well..."

Picked Up Key

"He's close"

"What is this doing here?"

Picked Up Bust

"Hmm... empty. Just like his heart."

"And... another key. Hopefully I'm getting at least a little closer to getting out of this hell hole."

"Painkillers... spilled all over the floor." 
"Wait, didn't Greg's wife OD off of something like these?" 
"Did he never clean these up?"

"God he must miss his family. If it weren't for me being kidnapped I might actually feel sorry for the guy."
"He lost what makes his home, well home."

"It's a newsletter from 5 years ago. It has Greg in it."

"Zot Times Sports: Legendary Baseball hitter Greg Mackey has finally retired from his amazing record setting career."
"Known for his 153 home run hits over just this season alone, #11 will be confident knowing that his record shouldn't be beaten anytime soon."
"We will definitely miss his smile on the field"

"I guess that explains how he has such a nice house."

"I wonder if this can be broken with enough force"

"Maybe I can just smash his face in with this. Or something... I just need to hit something."

Picked Up Baseball Bat

"Are there even enough doors for the amount of keys that he has?"

"..."

"..."

"I..."

"Why does he have all of this?"

"The monitor's unlocked, maybe I can call for help on it."

"Are you serious! It's not connected to a network."
"Actually, it seems to have only one file on it."
"Angelica.txt"
"I wonder what's in it."

"Is that what Angelica looked like? Greg never brough her outside and I never got to see her while she was alive."
"She looks a lot like me."
"..."
"Is that why he chose to kidnap me?"

"Oh there's one more line"
"If you run out of options, there is the safe right behind you. You know the code. You've been typing it by hand for years on end."

"Was he planning to end his own life with this?"

Picked Up Pistol

"He'll have to let me out now that I have this."

"It's over Greg, let me out right this minute or else."

"You don't understand Angeli-"

"That's not my name! My name is Hope! Hope!"
"Face it, she's dead Greg. Nothing is ever going to change that."

"Maybe nothing can. But with you in her place I can at least achive some peace of mind after I lost both of the loves of my life."

"Hand over the keys and let me out of here."

"Bu-"

"NO BUTS. I WILL SHOOT YOU!"

"FINE."

"Here, take him."

"*He's just walking up to me. What's to stop him from just taking the gun out of my hands and putting me back in my room. Or worse...*"

CHOICE: Trust Greg | Kill Greg

Trust:
"Just take it. Go. I realize now that nothing will salvage the wreck that is my heart."

"You're a monster, Greg. I hope you suffer for this."


Kill:
*A single gunshot fills the room. Then, silence fills the air of the Mackey House*
"Is.. Is it over?"
"He's gone, free to join the rest of his family."
"There's another key besides the one in the house. I wonder if that's for the basement?"
